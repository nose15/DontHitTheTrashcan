# DontHitTheTrashcan
Mobile game where you run forward and have to avoid hitting trashcans

This is basically the project that allowed me to gain understanding of OOP as well as sky-rocket my programming skills.
This should explain couple of messy and spaghetti scripts since few of them were written back when my only real projects had been some failed discord bots.
However this is probably the largest amount of code I've ever written in a single project so it's kind of a good indicator of what I'm capable of.
